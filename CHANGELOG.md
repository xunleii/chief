# Changelog

All notable changes to Chief are documented in this file.

## [0.7.0] - 2026-03-08

### Features
- **Pluggable agent backend** — in addition to Claude Code, Chief now supports OpenCode and Codex as agent CLIs thanks to @Simon-BEE and @tpaulshippy
- PRD robustness: handle large PRDs exceeding token limits, prevent merge/edit from truncating JSON, stable task IDs across PRD regeneration, watchdog for hung agents with no output, fix partially created PRD directories causing UI bugs, fix `.chief/` files committed despite gitignore
- Scrollable TUI task list with proper label wrapping

- Deduplicate flag parsing and convert helpers with improved test coverage
- Inline story ID and title into commit message template

## [0.6.1] - 2026-02-24

### Bug Fixes
- Agent prompt now uses explicit `{{PROGRESS_PATH}}` template variable so progress.md is written next to prd.json instead of the working directory

## [0.6.0] - 2026-02-21

### Features
- Continuous, responsive confetti animation on the completion screen
- Quit confirmation modal when Ralph loop is running

## [0.5.4] - 2026-02-20

### Bug Fixes
- TUI now manages story in-progress state directly on `EventStoryStarted`, fixing a race where the status was never shown

- Clear in-progress flags on completion, error, or max iterations
- Prevent non-JSON output from PRD conversion by disabling tools
