# PRD Format

Chief uses a single `prd.md` file that serves as both human-readable context and machine-readable structured data. Chief parses structured markdown headings, status fields, and checkbox items directly from this file — no separate JSON file is needed.

::: info Multi-agent support
Chief supports multiple agent backends: **Claude Code** (default), **Codex CLI**, and **OpenCode CLI**. This page uses "the agent" to refer to whichever backend you've configured. See [Configuration](/reference/configuration) for setup details.
:::

## File Structure

Each PRD lives in its own subdirectory inside `.chief/prds/`:

```
.chief/prds/my-feature/
├── prd.md        # Structured PRD (you write, Chief reads and updates)
├── progress.md   # Auto-generated progress log
└── claude.log    # Raw agent output from each iteration
```

- **`prd.md`** — Written by you, read and updated by Chief. Contains project context and structured user stories.
- **`progress.md`** — Written by the agent. Tracks what was done, what changed, and what was learned.
- **`claude.log`** (or `codex.log` / `opencode.log` / `cursor.log`) — Written by Chief. Raw output from the agent for debugging.

## prd.md — The PRD File

The `prd.md` file has two parts: **freeform context** at the top and **structured user stories** below. The freeform section gives the agent background on your project. The structured stories use specific markdown patterns that Chief parses to drive execution.

### Freeform Context

The top of the file is your chance to give the agent context that doesn't fit into structured fields. Write whatever helps the agent understand the project — there's no required format for this section.

**What to Include:**

- **Overview** — What are you building and why?
- **Technical context** — What stack, frameworks, and patterns does the project use?
- **Design notes** — Any constraints, preferences, or conventions to follow.
- **Examples** — Reference implementations, API shapes, or UI mockups.
- **Links** — Related docs, design files, or prior art.

### Structured User Stories

Below the freeform context, define your user stories using structured markdown headings that Chief parses:

- `### US-001: Story Title` — story heading (ID + title)
- `**Status:** done|in-progress|todo` — tracked by Chief
- `**Priority:** N` — execution order (optional; defaults to document order)
- `**Description:** ...` — story description (or freeform prose after heading)
- `- [ ] criterion` / `- [x] criterion` — acceptance criteria as checkboxes

### Example prd.md

```markdown
# User Authentication System

## Overview
We're building a complete authentication system for our SaaS application.
Users need to register, log in, reset passwords, and manage sessions.

## Technical Context
- Backend: Express.js with TypeScript
- Database: PostgreSQL with Prisma ORM
- Frontend: React with Next.js
- Auth: JWT tokens stored in httpOnly cookies

## Design Notes
- Follow existing middleware patterns in `src/middleware/`
- Use Zod for input validation (already a dependency)
- All API routes should return consistent error shapes
- Tests use Vitest — run with `npm test`

## Reference
- Existing user model: `prisma/schema.prisma`
- API route pattern: `src/routes/health.ts`

## User Stories

### US-001: User Registration

**Status:** todo
**Priority:** 1
**Description:** As a new user, I want to register an account so that I can access the application.

- [ ] Registration form with email and password fields
- [ ] Email format validation
- [ ] Password minimum 8 characters
- [ ] Confirmation email sent on registration
- [ ] User redirected to login after registration

### US-002: User Login

**Status:** todo
**Priority:** 2
**Description:** As a registered user, I want to log in so that I can access my account.

- [ ] Login form with email and password fields
- [ ] Error message for invalid credentials
- [ ] JWT token issued on success
- [ ] Redirect to dashboard on success

### US-003: Password Reset

**Status:** todo
**Priority:** 3
**Description:** As a user, I want to reset my password so that I can recover my account.

- [ ] "Forgot password" link on login page
- [ ] Email with reset link sent to user
- [ ] Reset token expires after 1 hour
- [ ] New password form with confirmation field
```

This file is included in the agent's context and also parsed by Chief to track story status and selection.

::: tip
The better your `prd.md`, the better the agent's output. Spend time on the freeform context — it pays off across every story.
:::

## Story Selection Logic

Chief picks the next story to work on using a simple, deterministic algorithm:

```
1. Filter stories without **Status:** done
2. Sort remaining stories by **Priority:** (ascending), or document order if unset
3. Pick the first one
4. Mark it as **Status:** in-progress
5. Start the iteration
```

### How Priority Works

Priority is a number where **lower = higher priority**. Chief always picks the lowest-numbered incomplete story:

| Story | Priority | Status | Selected? |
|-------|----------|--------|-----------|
| US-001 | 1 | `done` | No — already complete |
| US-002 | 2 | `todo` | **Yes — lowest priority number that isn't done** |
| US-003 | 3 | `todo` | No — US-002 goes first |

### What `in-progress` Does

When Chief starts working on a story, it sets `**Status:** in-progress`. This serves as a signal that the story is being actively worked on. When the story completes:

- `**Status:**` is set to `done`
- Acceptance criteria checkboxes are checked (`- [x]`)

If Chief is interrupted mid-iteration, the status may remain `in-progress`. On the next run, Chief will pick up the same story and continue.

### Completion Signal

When the agent finishes a story, it outputs `<chief-done/>` to signal that the current story is complete. Chief then marks the story as done in `prd.md` and selects the next one. When no incomplete stories remain, the loop ends naturally.

## Annotated Example PRD

Here's a complete `prd.md` with annotations explaining each part:

```markdown
# User Authentication                    ← Project heading (shown in TUI)

## Overview
Complete auth system with login,         ← Freeform context for the agent
registration, and password reset.

## User Stories

### US-001: User Registration            ← Story ID + title (appears in commits)

**Status:** done                         ← Chief tracks this (done/in-progress/todo)
**Priority:** 1                          ← Execution order (1 = first)
**Description:** As a new user, I want   ← Story description
to register an account so that I can
access the application.

- [x] Registration form with email       ← Acceptance criteria (checked = done)
      and password fields
- [x] Email format validation
- [x] Password minimum 8 characters
- [x] Confirmation email sent
- [x] User redirected to login

### US-002: User Login                   ← Next story

**Status:** in-progress                  ← Currently being worked on
**Priority:** 2
**Description:** As a registered user,
I want to log in so that I can access
my account.

- [x] Login form with email and         ← Some criteria already met
      password fields
- [ ] Error message for invalid          ← Still in progress
      credentials
- [ ] JWT token issued on success
- [ ] Redirect to dashboard on success

### US-003: Password Reset               ← Pending story

**Status:** todo
**Priority:** 3
**Description:** As a user, I want to
reset my password so that I can recover
my account.

- [ ] "Forgot password" link on login
- [ ] Email with reset link sent
- [ ] Reset token expires after 1 hour
- [ ] New password form with confirmation
```

## Best Practices

### Write Specific Acceptance Criteria

Each criterion should be concrete and verifiable. The agent uses these to determine what to build and when the story is done.

```markdown
<!-- ✓ Good — specific and testable -->
- [ ] Login form with email and password fields
- [ ] Error message shown for invalid credentials
- [ ] JWT token stored in httpOnly cookie on success
- [ ] Redirect to /dashboard after login

<!-- ✗ Bad — vague and subjective -->
- [ ] Nice login page
- [ ] Good error handling
- [ ] Secure authentication
```

### Keep Stories Small

A story should represent one logical piece of work. If a story has more than 5–7 acceptance criteria, consider splitting it into multiple stories.

**Too large:**
```markdown
### US-001: Complete Authentication System

- [ ] Registration form
- [ ] Login form
- [ ] Password reset
- [ ] Email verification
- [ ] OAuth integration
- [ ] Session management
- [ ] Rate limiting
- [ ] Account lockout
- [ ] Audit logging
```

**Better — split into focused stories:**
```markdown
### US-001: User Registration
### US-002: User Login
### US-003: Password Reset
### US-004: OAuth Integration
```

### Order Stories by Dependency

Use priority to ensure foundational stories are completed before dependent ones. The agent works through stories sequentially, so earlier stories can set up what later stories need.

```markdown
### US-001: Database Schema
**Priority:** 1

### US-002: API Endpoints
**Priority:** 2

### US-003: Frontend Forms
**Priority:** 3

### US-004: Integration Tests
**Priority:** 4
```

### Use Consistent ID Patterns

Story IDs appear in commit messages (`feat: [US-001] - User Registration`). Pick a pattern and stick with it:

- `US-001`, `US-002` — generic user stories
- `AUTH-001`, `AUTH-002` — feature-scoped prefixes
- `BUG-001`, `FIX-001` — for bug fix PRDs

### Give the Agent Context

The freeform context section at the top of `prd.md` is where you set the agent up for success. Since the context and structured stories live in the same file, the agent sees everything in one place. Include:

- What frameworks and tools the project uses
- Where to find existing patterns to follow
- Any constraints or conventions
- What "done" looks like beyond acceptance criteria

### Use `chief new` to Get Started

Running `chief new` scaffolds a `prd.md` with a template. You can also run `chief edit` to open an existing PRD for editing. This is the easiest way to create a well-structured PRD.
